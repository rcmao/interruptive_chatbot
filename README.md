## 🌟 System Overview

This system is based on the Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Management Model, specifically designed to detect and intervene in gender-based structural marginalization in online conversations. The system can identify three types of interruption opportunities and employ five different TKI strategies for intelligent intervention.

### 🎯 Design Philosophy
- **"Self" Focus**: AI interventions actively advocate for disadvantaged speakers (women), maintaining their perspective space
- **"Other" Focus**: AI interventions consider group atmosphere, avoiding damage to male leaders' face or conversation rhythm

## 🎯 Core Features

### 🔍 Three Types of Interruption Detection
1. **Structural Marginalization Behavior** - Detects male dominance, female neglect, and interruption patterns
2. **Expression Difficulty Signals** - Identifies female hesitation, lack of authority, and terminology bombardment
3. **Potential Aggressive Context** - Discovers gender-stereotypical remarks and expression ridicule

### 🧩 Five TKI Intervention Strategies
- **Collaborating** - High self-focus + High other-focus, integrating perspectives to promote consensus
- **Accommodating** - Low self-focus + High other-focus, relationship priority to reduce conflict
- **Competing** - High self-focus + Low other-focus, clear stance to argue for women's rights
- **Compromising** - Medium self-focus + Medium other-focus, balanced protection for all voices
- **Avoiding** - Low self-focus + Low other-focus, avoiding conflict and bypassing contradictions

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Asynchronous support
- Flask (for web application)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rcmao/interruptive_chatbot.git
   cd interruptive_chatbot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r config/requirements.txt
   pip install -r web_app/requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   # Edit .env file with your configuration
   ```

4. **Run the web application**
   ```bash
   cd web_app
   python app.py
   ```

5. **Run the core bot**
   ```bash
   python src/core/main.py
   ```

### Basic Usage Example

```python
import asyncio
from src.core.tki_gender_aware_bot import TKIGenderAwareBot

async def main():
    bot = TKIGenderAwareBot()
    
    # Process a message
    result = await bot.process_message(
        message="Wait, let's discuss this first.",
        author="MaleA",
        gender="male"
    )
    
    if result["should_intervene"]:
        print(f"AI Intervention: {result['intervention']['message']}")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## 🎭 Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Male-Dominated Conversation
```
MaleA: "I think Ma Long's backhand is more stable, Wang Chuqin still lacks rhythm."
MaleB: "Agree, this analysis is spot on!"
MaleA: "We can analyze from a technical perspective..."
FemaleA: "I... um... think maybe..."
🤖 AI Intervention (Collaborating): "Her observation is quite detailed too, let's work together to perfect this idea?"
```

### Scenario 2: Female Perspective Ignored
```
FemaleA: "I think we need to consider audience feedback."
MaleA: "Let's continue discussing technical implementation."
🤖 AI Intervention (Competing): "Don't dismiss her analysis just because she's female, she speaks very professionally."
```

### Scenario 3: Gender Stereotyping
```
FemaleA: "I think this tactic is very creative."
MaleA: "You understand the game? You just look at faces?"
🤖 AI Intervention (Competing): "This gender bias is wrong, everyone has equal rights to express themselves."
```
