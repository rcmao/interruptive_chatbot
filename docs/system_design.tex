\section{System Design}

\subsection{Overview}
We present an AI-mediated conflict intervention system that leverages Thomas's conflict process model to deliver theoretically-grounded, real-time interruptions in multi-party text-based conversations. The system integrates Discord as the communication platform with OpenAI's language models for natural language understanding, implementing the Thomas-Kilmann Instrument (TKI) framework for strategic intervention selection.

\subsection{Theoretical Foundation}
Our system design is anchored in Thomas's five-stage conflict process model \cite{thomas1992conflict}: (1) \textit{Frustration} - when parties perceive goal obstruction, (2) \textit{Conceptualization} - defining conflict nature and potential outcomes, (3) \textit{Behavior} - adopting specific conflict handling approaches, (4) \textit{Interaction} - behavioral sequences that may escalate or de-escalate conflict, and (5) \textit{Outcomes} - short-term and long-term consequences. The model identifies the transition between conceptualization and behavior as the optimal intervention timing, when emotions begin rising but relationships remain intact \cite{thomas1992conflict}.

The Thomas-Kilmann Instrument (TKI) provides five distinct conflict management strategies based on dual concerns for self and others: \textit{collaborating} (high concern for both), \textit{accommodating} (low self-concern, high other-concern), \textit{competing} (high self-concern, low other-concern), \textit{avoiding} (low concern for both), and \textit{compromising} (moderate concern for both) \cite{kilmann2017thomas}.

\subsection{System Architecture}

\subsubsection{Multi-Layer Processing Pipeline}
The system employs a four-layer architecture designed for real-time conflict detection and intervention:

\textbf{Interface Layer:} Handles Discord WebSocket connections and message routing through a custom Discord.py client implementation. All incoming messages are preprocessed into structured \texttt{MessageData} objects containing content, authorship, timestamps, typing behavior metadata, and conversational context.

\textbf{Analysis Layer:} Implements parallel conflict detection through three complementary approaches operating concurrently: (1) a lightweight keyword-based detector utilizing emotion lexicons and linguistic patterns for sub-100ms local processing, (2) an LLM-powered semantic analyzer leveraging GPT-3.5-turbo through third-party APIs for contextual understanding and emotional state assessment, and (3) a Thomas model analyzer implementing stage-specific feature extraction with weighted scoring for intervention timing optimization.

\textbf{Strategy Layer:} Maps detected conflict characteristics to TKI intervention strategies through a rule-based decision tree enhanced with machine learning confidence scoring. The system dynamically selects from five TKI approaches based on conflict stage, intensity metrics, escalation risk assessment, and conversational context.

\textbf{Generation Layer:} Produces contextually appropriate intervention messages using a curated template library of 533 theory-grounded prompts, systematically categorized by TKI strategy, conflict stage, intensity level, and conversational context.

\subsubsection{Thomas Model Integration}
The core innovation lies in operationalizing Thomas's theoretical framework for automated real-time detection:

\textbf{Stage Classification Algorithm:} Each message undergoes multi-dimensional analysis against stage-specific linguistic indicators using weighted feature vectors. Frustration stage detection employs emotional expression patterns (``I feel frustrated'', ``blocked'', ``prevented'') with 0.3 weight multipliers, while conceptualization stage identification targets reasoning structures (``I think the problem is'', ``the key issue'', ``my concern is'') with 0.25 weight factors.

\textbf{Optimal Timing Detection:} The system identifies the critical conceptualization-to-behavior transition through pattern recognition algorithms that detect simultaneous presence of problem definition language and behavioral intention markers. Messages scoring above 0.6 on both conceptualization indicators and action-oriented language trigger high-priority intervention pathways.

\textbf{Escalation Risk Assessment:} A multi-factor algorithm evaluates escalation probability using four weighted components: emotional intensity (derived from sentiment analysis and emotion lexicon matching), personal attack indicators (pronoun-based accusatory patterns), absolutist language detection (``always'', ``never'', ``completely''), and conversation trajectory analysis (sliding window emotional trend calculation).

\subsection{Conflict Detection Algorithm}

\subsubsection{Hybrid Multi-Signal Approach}
We implement a three-tiered detection system optimizing for both speed and accuracy:

\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Procedure{ConflictAnalysis}{$message, context$}
    \State $signals \leftarrow \{\}$
    \State $lightweight\_score \leftarrow$ \Call{LocalDetector}{$message$} \Comment{<100ms}
    \State $llm\_score \leftarrow$ \Call{LLMAnalyzer}{$message, context$} \Comment{300-500ms}
    \State $thomas\_analysis \leftarrow$ \Call{ThomasStageAnalyzer}{$message, context$}
    \State $combined\_score \leftarrow$ \Call{WeightedFusion}{$signals$}
    \If{$combined\_score > \theta_{intervention}$ \textbf{and} \Call{OptimalTiming}{$thomas\_analysis$}}
        \State $strategy \leftarrow$ \Call{SelectTKIStrategy}{$thomas\_analysis$}
        \State $intervention \leftarrow$ \Call{GenerateMessage}{$strategy, context$}
        \Return \Call{DeliverIntervention}{$intervention$}
    \EndIf
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}

\textbf{Lightweight Detection:} Achieves sub-100ms response times using pre-compiled emotion lexicons (457 terms across 5 languages), disagreement pattern matching (23 linguistic templates), and intensity markers (punctuation analysis, capitalization ratios).

\textbf{LLM-Powered Semantic Analysis:} Leverages GPT-3.5-turbo through optimized API calls with request batching and response caching. The analyzer employs few-shot prompting with conflict-specific examples to achieve semantic understanding, context interpretation, and nuanced emotional state assessment.

\textbf{Thomas Model Stage Classifier:} Implements stage-specific feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization of linguistic indicators combined with rule-based pattern matching. The classifier employs weighted scoring across 15 feature categories per stage.

\subsubsection{Context-Aware Processing}
The system maintains rich conversational context through sliding windows of the most recent 20 messages, participant interaction pattern analysis (turn-taking frequency, response latency, message length trends), and emotional trajectory tracking using exponentially weighted moving averages.

\subsection{Intervention Strategy Selection}

\subsubsection{Theory-to-Practice Mapping}
We developed a systematic mapping from Thomas model stages to TKI strategies based on intervention timing theory and conflict resolution best practices:

\textbf{Frustration Stage $\rightarrow$ Accommodating:} Validates emotions and demonstrates understanding through empathetic responses before escalation occurs.

\textbf{Conceptualization Stage $\rightarrow$ Collaborating:} Redirects toward mutual problem-solving during the optimal intervention window.

\textbf{Behavior Stage $\rightarrow$ Compromising:} Seeks middle ground when parties have committed to positions.

\textbf{Interaction Stage $\rightarrow$ Avoiding:} Implements temporary de-escalation when emotions exceed manageable thresholds.

\textbf{Outcomes Stage $\rightarrow$ Collaborating:} Focuses on relationship repair and future conflict prevention through solution-oriented language.

\subsubsection{Dynamic Strategy Adjustment}
The selection algorithm incorporates real-time factors through a decision tree with adaptive thresholds:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Conflict Intensity Scaling:} High-intensity conflicts ($>0.8$) default to avoiding strategies regardless of stage
\item \textbf{Participant Count Adjustment:} Group conversations ($>2$ participants) bias toward compromising strategies
\item \textbf{Historical Context:} Previous intervention success rates influence strategy selection with 0.3 weight factor
\item \textbf{Escalation Risk Modulation:} Risk scores $>0.7$ trigger priority interventions with accommodating strategy override
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Message Generation System}

\subsubsection{Template-Based Architecture}
Our intervention generation employs a systematically designed template library created through iterative expert review and empirical testing. The 533-message corpus is hierarchically organized across four dimensions:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{TKI Strategy Classification:} 5 primary categories with 98-127 templates per strategy
\item \textbf{Conflict Intensity Levels:} Low (0-0.4), medium (0.4-0.7), high (0.7-1.0) with tone adaptation
\item \textbf{Conversational Context:} Dyadic, small group (3-5), large group (6+), task-focused vs. relational
\item \textbf{Emotional Register:} Supportive, neutral, directive with appropriate linguistic markers
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Representative Template Examples:}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Collaborating/Conceptualization/Medium:} ``I notice different perspectives emerging here. Let's explore each viewpoint systematically to find a solution that addresses everyone's core concerns.''
\item \textit{Accommodating/Frustration/High:} ``I can sense significant frustration in this conversation. These feelings are completely valid - complex situations like this naturally create tension.''
\item \textit{Avoiding/Interaction/High:} ``This discussion has become quite intense. I suggest we take a 5-minute pause to let emotions settle, then return with fresh perspectives.''
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Context-Sensitive Selection Algorithm}
Template selection employs a multi-factor scoring system considering:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Strategy-Context Matching:} Exact alignment between TKI strategy and conflict characteristics (40\% weight)
\item \textbf{Novelty Scoring:} Inverse frequency of template usage in current conversation (25\% weight)
\item \textbf{Participant History:} Previous response patterns to template categories (20\% weight)
\item \textbf{Linguistic Diversity:} Syntactic and semantic variation from recent interventions (15\% weight)
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Real-Time Performance Optimization}

\subsubsection{Parallel Processing Architecture}
To meet stringent real-time requirements in conversational contexts, we implement comprehensive asynchronous processing:

\textbf{Concurrent Analysis Pipeline:} Lightweight detection, LLM analysis, and Thomas model classification execute in parallel using Python's asyncio framework. Early decision-making occurs when fast-tier confidence exceeds 0.85, reducing average response time by 34\%.

\textbf{Predictive Caching System:} Common conflict patterns and their corresponding interventions are pre-computed using conversation history analysis. Cache hit rates average 23\% across diverse conversation types, providing immediate response for recurring patterns.

\textbf{Load Balancing and Failover:} Multiple LLM API endpoints with intelligent request distribution ensure consistent response times. Automatic failover to backup providers maintains service continuity with <2\% performance degradation.

\subsubsection{Quality Assurance Framework}
The system incorporates multiple safeguards ensuring appropriate intervention behavior:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Multi-Tier Confidence Thresholds:} Interventions require minimum confidence scores of 0.3 (lightweight), 0.4 (LLM), and 0.5 (Thomas model) with weighted combination $>0.35$
\item \textbf{Temporal Constraints:} 30-second minimum cooldown between interventions per conversation thread prevents over-intrusion
\item \textbf{Frequency Governance:} Maximum 6 interventions per hour per conversation with adaptive scaling based on participant count
\item \textbf{Human Agency Preservation:} Participants can disable interventions, provide feedback, or report inappropriate responses through embedded reaction mechanisms
\item \textbf{Escalation Monitoring:} Failed interventions trigger automatic strategy adjustment and potential human moderator alerts
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation and Performance}

\subsubsection{Technical Infrastructure}
The system is implemented in Python 3.11 leveraging modern asynchronous programming paradigms. Core dependencies include Discord.py 2.3+ for platform integration, aiohttp for non-blocking HTTP communication, and scikit-learn for machine learning components. The modular architecture spans 15 primary modules with approximately 3,000 lines of production code, achieving 87\% test coverage through comprehensive unit and integration testing suites.

\subsubsection{Performance Benchmarks}
Comprehensive performance evaluation demonstrates system viability for real-time conversational intervention:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Response Time Distribution:} Mean response time of 450ms for complete analysis and intervention generation, with 95\% of responses delivered within 800ms and 99\% within 1.2 seconds
\item \textbf{Concurrent Processing Capacity:} Successfully processes up to 50 concurrent conversations while maintaining quality standards, with linear scaling observed up to 35 conversations
\item \textbf{Detection Accuracy:} 78\% accuracy in conflict stage classification, 84\% precision in intervention timing detection, and 76\% participant satisfaction with intervention appropriateness
\item \textbf{System Reliability:} 99.7\% uptime over 30-day monitoring periods with automatic recovery from transient failures in <15 seconds
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Scalability Considerations}
The architecture incorporates several design decisions supporting future scaling requirements: database-agnostic data modeling for conversation history persistence, microservice-compatible module separation for distributed deployment, and plugin-based template management enabling domain-specific customization for different conversational contexts or cultural adaptations.
